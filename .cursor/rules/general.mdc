## Code Style

- Use TypeScript.
- File names should be in lowercase with dash separators.
- Api, commands and config in README.md should be ordered alphabetically.
- Test. 1) Use vitest for test cases, not jest. 2) Test cases should be in the same file as the code that is being tested. e.g. `foo.test.ts` for `foo.ts`.
